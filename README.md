# Cardioid Generator 🎨🖥️🌀
Welcome to the Cardioid Generator! This application allows you to visualize and explore the beauty of cardioid curves, an elegant mathematical pattern often seen in nature and art. Whether you're a math enthusiast, a student, or someone who enjoys playing with graphical tools, this generator is designed for you.

## Features ✨
**Interactive UI:** Easily generate cardioid curves with adjustable parameters.
**Customizable:** Modify the number of points, radii, and multipliers to see how the curve changes.
**Real-Time Visualization:** Watch the cardioid curve form as you adjust settings.
**Resizable Window:** Drag from the edges to resize the app as needed.

## How It Works 💡
The cardioid is a mathematical curve that resembles a heart shape. It is generated by connecting points on a circle's circumference based on a multiplier. Here's how it works: Points are placed evenly around the circle. Each point is connected to another based on a formula involving a multiplier. As the multiplier changes, different patterns and cardioid shapes emerge.

## Installation ⚙️
To use this generator, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/goktuggokcenO/Cardioid-Generator.git
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:
``` bash
python main.py
```

## Usage 🖱️
Open the app.
Use the sliders to adjust the number of points, the multiplier, and other parameters.
Watch the cardioid shape dynamically update.
